# **Project 1**:

In this project, we will bring together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically:

Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
